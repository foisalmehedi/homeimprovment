For one weekend each May, 9th Street - in the heart of South Philadelphia - closes down traffic and a huge, multi-block festival takes over the neighborhood.

It all starts with the great sights, sounds and aromas of America&acute;s oldest continuously operating open-air market: South Philadelphia&acute;s famous Italian Market. And the most important thing for you to bring with you is your appetite.

In addition to the blocks of curb vendors and specialty butcher, cheese, gift and cookware shops that line the market, there will also be street-side merchants selling specially prepared foods just for the Festival.

Expect to see stands offering a display of fresh sausage and peppers, antipasto salads, roast pork sandwiches, cheeses, cured meats, an infinite array of pastries, famous mango roses and so much more.

Many nearby restaurants will extend their table service to the sidewalk so you can dine alfresco and enjoy the festival atmosphere.

A stunning smorgasbord of flavors will be on full display during the Festival, as vendors line the street, musicians roam the crowds and top chefs show off some of their best techniques at live cooking demonstrations.

For a full schedule and lineup of musicians, performances and demonstrations, be sure to visit the Festival&acute;s official website.
<h3>Insider Tip </h3>

Belying its name, the Italian Market is not just Italian anymore. In fact, it&acute;s a veritable melting pot of international cultures and cuisines.

You can choose from several excellent Asian restaurants serving delicious Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches and piping hot bowls of pho.

Or savor amazingly flavorful tacos, spicy tamales and several other authentic Mexican favorites from La Lupe and Taqueria La Veracruzanas. And that&acute;s just the beginning.

There is so much great eating in and around the Italian Market that you&acute;ll want to return again and again.

		Topics of previous productions included a musical review of favorite Broadway tunes coming to life with a decidedly gay perspective; dealing with one inner burdens while on a pilgrimage to India; turning the damages of sexual abuse to that which gives rise to transformation; intertwined lives of gay men and the women who love them; delving into whether Shakespeare was bi-sexual and if the subject of his love sonnets was a young boy; as well as two productions specifically presented as a part of our Young Audience Presentations.

		Of course, The Roots couldn&acute;t just throw a music festival with their favorite acts and not grace the stage. The hometown heroes will be performing two sets of their unique, high-energy live sound.
		
		Live music will be playing from two stages during this all-day event.

		You are never far from history when in Germantown, one of Philadelphia&acute;s most historic neighborhoods. However, it is on full display during the Revolutionary Germantown Festival, a day-long festival that celebrates the rich history of Germantown and features the annual reenactment of the Battle of Germantown, the only military battle ever fought within the borders of Philadelphia.
		
		Escorted bus and walking tours make getting around simple while special programs at ten historic sites throughout the community provide something for every size and taste.
		
		Learn the inside stories of some of Philadelphia&acute;s most important colonial landmarks: put your hand to colonial paper-making techniques at Historic Rittenhouse Town; try out some early American toys at Upsala; and “meet” British General Howe at the Deshler-Morris House, his one-time war headquarters. The historic re-enactment of the 1777 Battle of Germantown takes place at Cliveden.
		
		In addition to Rittenhouse Town, Upsala, the Deschler-Morris House and Clivedon, you&acute;ll visit the Concord School and Upper Burying Ground, where solider and officers are buried; Grumblethorpe, site of one of the battles legendary death scenes; the Johnson House, which showcase the role of African-Americans in the Revolutionary War; and two of the cities most famous colonial houses, Stenton and Wyck.
		<h3>Come Prepared </h3>
		
		There is fee for entry and parking may be limited. It is recommended that visitors consider taking public transportation to Germantown Avenue for the festivities.
		<h3>Don&acute;t Miss </h3>
		
		The battle reenactments at Cliveden are absolute must-sees.
		<h3>Outsider&acute;s Tip</h3>
		
		Make the most of Revolutionary Germantown Festival by purchasing a Passport that covers the cost of admission to all participating sites for the day. The Passport contains a list of the timed events throughout the day along with a map for self guided walking tours of the Germantown area. Passports can be pre-ordered or purchased the day of the event. An individual pass is $15 and the family pass is $25.
